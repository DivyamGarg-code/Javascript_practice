Interpreter -> executes code line by line , it does not know what will happen in the next line, Fast execution as code not gets compiled first  
Complier -> whole code is complied even before execution 

JIT complilation ->just in time complilation
Q Is javascript a interpreted language or a compile language?
Ans. Javascript can behave as an interpreted language as well as compile language, it basically depends upon the js engine 
Most of the modern browsers and js engines uses an interpreter + compiler both together 

Google v8 engine is considered to be the fastest browser engine
