/*
CORS is a mechanism which uses additional http mechanism to tell the browser weather a specific webapp can share resource with another webapp but  the point is both the web apps may have different origin
If they have the same origin they can share the resource very easily but if they dont have the same origin then they need to follow the cors mechanism
